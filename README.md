# Uuups WordPress Theme

Uuups is an experiment how to bring your theme to the next level. This is playground from two starter themes:

1. [Justin Tadlock's starter theme](https://github.com/justintadlock/abc)
1. [Mine starter theme called Foxer](https://github.com/justintadlock/abc)

All the ideas are still open and there are no documentation.

## My wishlist

I have hopes and dreames for the starter theme:

- Accessibility ready out of the box.
- Clean semantic HTML without lots of extra DIVs
- Scalable, modular CSS/SASS architecture. It should guide developers how they write their CSS.
- Ready for Gutenberg and a maximum WYSIWYG experience.
- ES6 for JavaScript
- Gulp, Webpack, or npm scripts for automated tasks like compiling assets, optimising images and SVGs, CSS and JS linting, SVG system, and being design system ready.
