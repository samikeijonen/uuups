# Uuups &ndash; experimental WordPress Theme

Uuups is an experiment how to bring your theme to the next level. This is playground from two starter themes:

1. [Justin Tadlock's starter theme](https://github.com/justintadlock/abc)
1. [Mine starter theme called Foxer](https://github.com/justintadlock/abc)

All the ideas are still open and there are no documentation.

## My wishlist

I have hopes and dreames for the starter theme:

- Accessibility ready out of the box.
- Clean semantic HTML without lots of extra DIVs
- Scalable, modular CSS/SASS architecture. It should guide developers how they write their CSS.
- Ready for Gutenberg and a maximum WYSIWYG experience.
- ES6 for JavaScript.
- Gulp, Webpack, or npm scripts for automated tasks like    - compiling assets.
  - optimising images and SVGs.
  - CSS, JS, and PHPCS linting.
  - SVG system.
  - being design system ready.

## Directory structure

Directory structure aims to be modern app-like, what ever that means :)

- `resources` folder for editing theme for your needs. This is where the most of the magic happens.
	- `resources/views` have all the template structure and partials files.
	- `resources/styles` have SASS files.
	- `resources/scripts` have JS files.
	- `resources/svg-icons` have SVG icons.
	- `resources/lang` have language files.

## Installation and setup

Starter theme uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage its dependencies. Install both on your machine before using this starter theme.

Theme has [Hybrid Core 5.0](https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/tree/5.0) as a must have dependency.

### Creating new theme

WordPress themes lives in the `wp-content/themes` folder. This is where we fetch our starter theme files.

```
# Go to the `themes` directory of your WordPress installation.
$ cd wp-content/themes
```

You can download files from this repo or clone the repository to the `wp-content/themes` directory.

```
$ git clone -b master git@github.com:samikeijonen/uuups.git <theme-name>
```

Make sure youâ€™re in the root folder of your theme.

```
$ cd <theme-name>
```

1. Install composer dependencies.

```
$ composer install
```

1. Install node dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

1. Activate your theme under `Appearance > Themes`. Or use WP-CLI to activate your theme.

```
wp theme activate <theme-name>
```
